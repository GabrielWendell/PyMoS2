# `PyMoS2`
Python Modules for a Static Star Model
---

`PyMoS2` is a program that aims to offer a comprehensive simulation of a simple model of the interior of a static, non-magnetic star of 1 solar mass $(1$ $M_{\odot})$, from the production of energy through nuclear reactions, the radiative and convective transport of energy and the movement of a convective cell.

## Key Features

- `Stellar_core`: models energy production in the star's core. It implements the reactions involved in the PP chain and from this takes the profile of the relevant parameters depending on the radius.

- `Stellar_structure`: models the structure of the star from the core to the surface and delimits the radiative and convective transport zones in the stellar interior.

- `Stellar_convection`: models the hydrodynamic movement of a convective cell in the stellar interior and generates an animation of the movement.
